#The aim of the assignment is to investigate how the following quantities change depending on the number of dimensions. For the purposes of this task we use the Euclidean distance.

# We have a hyperball with a radius equal to 1.0 inscribed inside a hypercube with edges length equal to 2.0.
# Hyperball in multidimensional space is defined as a set of points whose distance from its centre is no greater than its radius.
# We randomly fill the hypercube with evenly distributed points. What % of those points would be inside the hyperball, and what % outside â€“ in the corners?
